        return `**Complete UK Global Talent Visa Timeline**

**⏰ Phase 1: Preparation (3-6 months)**

**Evidence Collection (2-4 months)**
• Gather career achievements and quantify impact
• Collect awards, media coverage, speaking invitations
• Document open source contributions, patents, publications
• Prepare business success metrics and project outcomes
• Organize academic papers, technical certifications

**Reference Letter Process (1-3 months)**
• Identify 3 suitable senior referees in your field
• Approach referees with clear briefing on application requirements
• Allow 2-4 weeks per referee to write high-quality letters
• Review letters for completeness and tech focus
• **Start early** - this often takes longer than expected

**Document Drafting (2-4 weeks)**
• Write compelling personal statement (under 1,000 words)
• Create focused CV highlighting tech achievements (3 pages max)
• Prepare online application form and evidence descriptions

**⚖️ Phase 2: Tech Nation Assessment (8-16 weeks)**

**Standard Processing: 8-12 weeks**
• Submit complete application with all evidence
• Tech Nation expert panel reviews application
• Decision: Endorsed, Not Endorsed, or Request for More Information
• If rejected, must wait 6 months before reapplying

**Priority Processing: 3-5 weeks**
• Additional cost: £500-£1,500
• Same thorough review process, expedited timeline
• Recommended only if you have urgent timing needs
• Still same quality requirements and rejection risk

**🏠 Phase 3: Home Office Visa Application (1-8 weeks)**

**Application Requirements:**
• Must have Tech Nation endorsement first
• Complete online visa application
• Attend biometric appointment
• Provide financial evidence
• Pay visa fees and health surcharge

**Processing Times:**
• **Outside UK:** 3 weeks standard, 1 week priority (+£500-800)
• **Inside UK:** 8 weeks standard, 1 week priority (+£500-800)
• **Family members:** Can apply simultaneously or join later

**📊 Realistic Timeline Planning**

**Optimistic Scenario: 5-7 months**
• 3 months preparation + 3-4 weeks priority processing + 1-3 weeks visa
• Requires: Well-prepared evidence, responsive referees, priority processing fees
• Risk: Limited time for corrections if issues arise

**Standard Scenario: 8-12 months**
• 4-5 months preparation + 8-12 weeks standard processing + 3-8 weeks visa  
• Most common timeline for well-organized applicants
• Allows buffer time for unexpected delays

**Conservative Scenario: 12-18 months**
• 6 months preparation + potential reapplication + processing delays
• Accounts for: Referee delays, evidence gaps, application improvements
• Recommended if no urgent UK start date

**🎯 Success Timeline Optimization**

**Start Early Actions:**
• Begin evidence collection 12+ months before desired UK start date
• Contact potential referees 6+ months in advance  
• Research Tech Nation criteria thoroughly before starting

**Parallel Processing:**
• Collect evidence while drafting personal statement
• Contact referees while organizing other documents
• Prepare visa documents during Tech Nation assessment

**Risk Management:**
• Have backup referees identified in case of delays
• Collect more evidence than needed (then select best 10 items)
• Consider priority processing if timeline is critical

**📅 Key Milestones Checklist:**
- [ ] Evidence collection complete
- [ ] All 3 reference letters received and reviewed  
- [ ] Personal statement drafted and refined
- [ ] CV finalized at 3 pages max
